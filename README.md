# peak test runner framework

This test runner is based on the radanalyticsio openshift-test-kit
repository, which in turn is based on a library of bash test functions
at https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/hack/lib.

In a nutshell, the test functions allow you to execute a command
from a bash shell and then check the status and/or output. You
can also wait for a particular result with a timeout. This provides
a very flexible foundation for testing any application that can
be managed from a CLI.

The peak repository includes it's own custom *setup.sh* and *run.sh*
scripts tailored for testing OpenShift operators and/or OpenShift
applications launched from templates or manifests. There is a
Dockerfile for an s2i builder that will produce a test image
based on the *run.sh* script and a test repo. Test images can be used
standalone or with the operator-sdk scorecard command (see below).

The test runner can also be used for things outside of OpenShift -- if
there is no current OpenShift login and it is run from the commandline,
it will not attempt to execute any OpenShift setup commands.

It is designed to pull in tests from specified git repositories,
so that tests for particular operators can be maintained separately
from the operator.

## initializing the git submodule in the test repository

When you first clone the test repository, you need to do this

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

## Building test images with s2i

The s2i image can be built from the root of this repository, for example

```bash
podman build . -t quay.io/tmckayus/peaks2i
podman push quay.io/tmckayus/peaks2i
```

Then a test image for a particular repository can be generated in OpenShift.
Just make sure for authenticated repositories that you've created a push secret and
linked it to the builder service account!



```
# Creating a push secret if you need one
oc create secret docker-registry secret-push --docker-server=$DOCKER_SERVER --docker-username=$DOCKER_USER --docker-password=$DOCKER_PASSWORD --docker-email=$DOCKER_EMAIL
oc secret link builder secret-push

# Launching the build
oc new-build quay.io/tmckayus/peaks2i~https://github.com/tmckayus/rad-spark-sample-tests --strategy=source --to-docker=true --to=quay.io/tmckayus/testimage
```

A subdirectory in the test repository can be specified as a relative path with the SOURCE_PATH environment variable, for example

```
oc new-build quay.io/tmckayus/peak~https://github.com/tmckayus/my-repo -e SOURCE_DIR=path/to/tests --strategy=source --to-docker=true --to=quay.io/tmckayus/mytest:latest"
```

Once built you can display help for the image with podman

```
podman run --rm -t quay.io/tmckayus/testimage usage
```

### Running test image standalone

The default command for the test image executes "/opt/peak/run.sh -p". This runs all of the
included tests in the current project with summary logs. Just launch the image in a Kubernetes pod
with no explicit command and check the pod logs.

To use different options, set the command explicitly in the container spec, for example

```bash
spec:
  containers:
  - image: quay.io/tmckayus/testpeak:4
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    command:
    - /opt/peak/run.sh
    - -p
    - -i
```

### Running test image from operator-sdk alpha scorecard

The *scorecard* script in the test image wraps a call to *run.sh* and produces JSON output that can
be consumed by the operator-sdk scorecard command. Run the test image with the *usage* command as shown
above to see options to *scorecard*.

Visit https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs for complete information on using a test image with the scorecard command,
including how to create a real bundle directory, etc.

Here is a quickstart, assuming you have built (or downloaded) the lastest *operator-sdk*

Create a config.yaml file for scorecard like this

```bash
tests:
- name: "mytest"
  image: quay.io/tmckayus/testimage
  entrypoint: 
  - scorecard
  labels:
    suite: peak
```

and then run the test like this (*somedir* just has to exist and can be empty, ideally it's a bundle directory as described by the docs)

```bash
operator-sdk alpha scorecard -n somenamespace --selector=suite=peak -c ./config.yaml -w 300s -o json somedir

# wait for tests to complete ...

          "All tests passed. Use 'base64 -d' to view the logs."
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Note that by default the results will list the repository name as the name of the test. This can be overridden during image creation by adding '-e TESTNAME=desiredname' to the build command.


To see the log in plain text, pipe the log into 'base64 -d' like this

```bash
$ echo L29wdC9wZWFrL3Rlc3QvbGliL2J1aWxkL2NvbnN0YW50cy5zaAoKcGFzc2VkOiAvb3B0L3BlYWsvb3BlcmF0b3ItdGVzdHMvcmFkLXNwYXJrLXNhbXBsZS10ZXN0cy90ZXN0LnNoCgovb3B0L3BlYWsvcnVuLnNoIHRvb2sgMzcgc2Vjb25kcwpbSU5GT10gRXhpdGluZyB3aXRoIDAK | base64 -d

## setup.sh script

The setup.sh script does several things to set up a test run:

* Installs specified operators for which a package manifest
  can be found in OpenShift. This essentially means that it
  can install any operator visible in OperatorHub at the time
  setup.sh is run (so it is possible to test custom operators
  as well as certified or community operators, etc)
  
* Creates a namespace with a name based on the operator. This
  namespace will be used to run tests.

* Installs operators based on available install mode. Operators
  that can run globally will be installed in openshift-operators,
  operators that must run in a single namespace will run in the
  namespace created for tests.

* Clones a git repository containing tests for the operator if
  specified. The tests will be stored in a subdirectory under
  *operator-tests* named for the operator.

* Optionally supports a *-d* flag which will cause the specified
  operators to be re-installed and the associated namespaces to
  be recreated. This guarantees a clean test run.

* Optionally supports a -D flag which delete operators and namespaces
  for cleanup.

### usage of setup.sh

```bash
setup.sh [-d|-D] [-pto] OPERATOR_FILE
```

The *-d* flag optionally causes setup.sh to uninstall any specified operators
and delete namespaces named for the operators before re-installing
and re-creating those namespaces.

The *-D* flag optionally causes setup.sh to uninstall any specified operators
and delete the associated namespaces, without reinstalling anything.
This is a useful cleanup option to leave a system as you found it. Be careful,
if an operator was already installed before you started, it will be removed!

The "-pto" options optionally let you control what setup.sh will manage
(projets, tests, and operators). The default is all three.

### OPERATOR_FILE

The operator file contains space-separated tuples, one per line:

```bash
OPERATOR_NAME DISTRIBUTION_CHANNEL [GIT_TEST_REPOSITORY] [GIT_BRANCH]
```

for example

```bash
radanalytics-spark alpha https://github.com/tmckayus/rad-spark-tests v1
```

This tuple would cause setup.sh to do the following:

* Create a *radanalytics-spark-xxxx* namespace. Delete it first if *-d* is set.

* Install the *radanalytics-spark* operator from the *alpha* channel using the OLM
  Since radanalytics-spark can be installed globally, it will be installed in the
  *openshift-operators* namespace instead of *radanalytics-spark-xxx*. Uninstall the
  operator first if *-d* is set.

* Clone the *tmckayus/rad-spark-tests* repository from github into the
  *operator-tests/radanalytics-spark* subdirectory and set the current branch
  to v1 instead of the default branch. The setup.sh script will not overwrite the
  test subdirectory if it exists.

### Notes on OPERATOR_FILE entries

* If a tuple names an operator which cannot be found in OpenShift, *setup.sh* will
  still create the namespace and clone the test repository. This is useful for
  testing things that are not operators (like applications from templates)

* If a tuple names an operator which cannot be found in OpenShift, the channel
  value has no effect

* The git test repository is optional

* The branch value for the test repository is optional. Naming a branch that
  does not exist will cause the clone to fail, and the error will be visible
  in the console.

### Running outside of OpenShift

If there is no current OpenShift login, *setup.sh*

* will not try to install any operators
* will not try to create any namespaces
* WILL clone the test repositories

## run.sh script

The *run.sh* script will run test files ending in *.sh* in subdirectories under
the *operator-tests* directory. The search will be recursive, so test subdirectories
may contain subdirectories.

For each top-level subdirectory, if there there is a current OpenShift login, the script
will set the project to the namespace associated with the name of the subdirectory.

Within a particular test subdirectory, files will be executed in alphabetical order.
This can be particularly useful for applications that are not installed as operators --
just make the alphabetically first file in the directory an install script for the application.

### usage

```bash
run.sh [regexp]
```

If *regexp* is supplied, it will be a regular expression filter on the absolute path of
the test files.

## Adding tests

* Create a new test repository somewhere to hold your tests
* Write .sh test files at the top level of the new repository
* Add an entry to the OPERATOR_FILE that lists your operator,
  the distribution channel, and the new test repository
* Rerun setup.sh to add the new test directory in your current
  checkout of peak and install the operator

### TEST_DIR environment variable

The $TEST_DIR environment variable in your test scripts
will point to the *operator-tests* subdirectory.

### operator-tests/common

The *common* file is used to initialize some general
env vars for the test scripts and intialize the bash
test library itself.

All test files should source *common* like this

```bash
source $TEST_DIR/common
```

Currently common sets two environment variables that
may be used in test scripts

* MY_SCRIPT is the name of the test script that is currently running
* RESOURCE_DIR is the name of a path where temporary files can be put
